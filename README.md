# open-genes-agent
Agent that replies questions on open-genes database

NOTE: we are in a migration process where open-genes related features will migrate from https://github.com/longevity-genie/longevity_gpts to this repository.
This repository will use https://github.com/longevity-genie/just-chat approach. This will allow developing agents on different longevity databases separately to be finally merged together
